PROJECT TITLE: Kleene Star Converter
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To complete a team project for CS 357(Theory of Computation)
                    at the University of Portland. Will take a NFA or DFA as input,
                    and convert it to a NFA that accepts A*. 
VERSION or DATE: v1.0 12/03/15
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open BlueJ. Right click on StarProject file, click on 
                           void main (String[] args) and then click ok to run the program.
AUTHORS: Rachel Smith and Nerissa Lemon
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
                    Step 1: Start project (see above).
                    Step 2: Enter "NFA" or "DFA" into the terminal and press enter.
                    Step 3: Enter a start state that is no more than 3 characters, and press enter.
                    Step 4: Enter automata alphabet. Enter 1 character at a time or "empty" for epsilon, and press enter after each
                            letter. 20 letters maximum for the alphabet. Enter "done" when done inputing alphabet and press enter.
                    Step 5: Enter all states, one by one like in step 4, max three characters per state. Include start state.
                    Step 6: Enter accept states, one by one like in step 4, max three characters per state.
                    Step 7: Enter transitions according to prompt for each state and each character of the alphabet you inputed previously.
                    Step 8: Program Output is displayed in a broken up 5-tuple format. If you want to run the program again, repeat the above steps.
